# Stock Market Analysis

## Programming Language

Python

## Project Description

This project aims to build a basic analysis of the current state of the stock market based on data scraped from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com). The project will examine the most active stocks, the gainers, and the losers.

This project focuses on answering the following research questions:

1. Can we predict which stocks will be in which group (most active, gainers, losers, etc.)?
2. Can we predict how much a stock will gain or lose with at least an 80% accuracy?

The data collected for this project is scrapped from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com). All gathered data belongs to Yahoo.
